## Blaze Runner: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Blaze Runner game for Android!

This is an scifi 3D-endless runner game developed by Kandarp Devmurari. The app is available on Google Play Store.

As an avid game developer/game user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when the games collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this game to collect any personally identifiable information. The only data that is stored is the name of the user playing(to indicate the highscores in the leaderboard) which is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by installing the game.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the game protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
